# 2024 Annual Report: SIG Release

## Current initiatives and Project Health

1. What work did the SIG do this year that should be highlighted?

The Release Engineering and Release Team subprojects have new owners.

The Release Notes subteam has been eliminated and its duties divided between Release Docs and Release Comms. The Bug Triage and CI Signal teams have been merged into Release Signal.

2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?

None.

3. Did you have community-wide updates in 2024 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?
