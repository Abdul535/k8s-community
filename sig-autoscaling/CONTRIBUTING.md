# Contributing to SIG Autoscaling

The best place to find information and resources to be able to participate and support SIG Autoscaling's work is to visit the Autoscaling Special Interest Group [Github repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling) and the [README](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling) file.
You can also learn more about the [SIG Autoscaling Charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-autoscaling/charter.md) following the link.

## Getting started
Joining the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-autoscaling) will get you invited to the general SIG meetings.

Our Regular SIG Meeting is Mondays at 16:00 CET (Central European Time). This is a general forum for wider issues as well as most of the subprojects.

Most of the work of the SIG is undertaken by our [Subprojects](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling#subprojects) where new contributors are always welcome. Some of the subprojects have their own dedicated meetings - either on an ad-hoc basis, or organised more regularly. See the above link and each subproject's Slack channel for more details.

Contributions are made via Pull requests.  Before opening a pull request, contributors must sign the [CNCF Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md)
